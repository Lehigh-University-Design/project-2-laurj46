                        </summary>
                        <p> Pulling the espresso shot is a crucial first step, since steamed milk cannot sit out after
                            being steamed. When steamed milk isnâ€™t used immediate after steaming, it gets over frothy at
                            the top and loses consistency underneath. In order to keep the milk prime for latte art, it
                            needs to be uses immediately, so having the espresso pulled for the latte before steaming
                            the milk is important.</p>
                        <p>Tip: Steam the milk while the espresso is being pulled, rather than waiting for it to be
                            finished so that the espresso holds a constant flavor that it may lose if it sits for too
                            long. </p>

                        </summary>
                        <p>Steaming the milk requires different heights depending on the size of the drink being made,
                            but for lattes, it tends to be 16oz of milk.The milk gets poured into the steaming cup and
                            the steamer rests in the pour spout to insure it does not move around during the steaming
                            process. After turning the steamer on, air needs to be let into the milk by pulling the cup
                            down a little bit and allowing the steamer to get close to the top of the milk line. </p>

                        <p> Letting in the air only takes one or two seconds, then the steamer needs to go back down
                            toward the bottom, otherwise the milk will be all foam and the steamer will make screeching
                            noises. The milk will then reach a good consistency for latte art, and you can tell when to
                            turn the steamer off when the foam of the milk gets close to the top of the steaming cup.

                        <p>In order to properly make the latte, the milk needs to be poured around in a circular motion
                            around the outer edges of the cup immediately after steaming. When the cup reaches about 85%
                            full, stop pouring and begin the design.</p>

                                Step 4: Start the Design >>
                            </div>
                        </summary>
                        <p>The easiest latte art design to start with is the tulip design. For this design, pour a
                            circle shape, stop and lift the pour. Then, make another circle shape, pushing into the
                            first one so that it spreads into a crescent shape; repeat that step again. To pull it all
                            together, at the end of the final pour, lift slightly and drag quickly through the whole
                            design so that a line goes down the center. </p>

                        <p> Tip: It is important to make sure that the remaining foam does not fall into the cup, since
                            the left-over milk at the bottom tends to be mostly bubbles and foam that is too thick for a
                            quality latte.</p>
